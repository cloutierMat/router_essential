# Router Essential

You will find here only the barebone needed code to replicate what Tony did in class today to route his endpoints to a seperate file

It is by no means a replacement to his course and slides, where you will find much more information. 
It should, however, make it easier read that section of the code.

## Instalation
In your terminal
```
git clone https://github.com/cloutierMat/router_essential.git
cd router_essential
npm install
npm start
```

## Try it out
In your browser try those 3 urls and see where they come from.

Hopefully it will bring some light in the darkness of everybody's life
